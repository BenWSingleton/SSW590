              <p>This website is to report our progress on a project for SSW-590 DevOps Principles and Practices at Stevens Institute of Technology and to be part of the very same project.
              We choose to create a simple CI/CD pipeline to deploy this static website. The project ties together several technologies to 
              accomplish this. The code is hosted on a GitHub repo. When code is pushed to the repo, an instance of Jenkins running on a 
              DigitalOcean server pulls the latest commit. Jenkins will then trigger a bash script that will create and start a NGINX 
              container for the latest commit. 
              </p>
              <p> 
              The website itself is simple, using HTML and a CSS template; however, the website is not the focus of the project. We choose to build a static
              site because we were familar with how to do so. This allowed us to focus on what was important, learning and configuring the various
              technologies involved. While we were familar with some tools such as Git and bash, others such as Jenkins and Docker were new to us. 
              This project allowed us to become familiar with all of them. The result is a CI/CD pipeline that combines these various technologies 
              into one process. 
              </p>
              <p>
              The following sections describe how we used each these technologies in more detail as well as our experience while working on the project.

              Our project starts with GitHub, where we choose to host our code. The benefits of using source control are well known. Our repo 
              provides us with a single location to host our code. It makes it easier to add features and manage sucsessive versions. As 
              mentioned, we were both familar with Git but this project afforded us the opportunity to grow our skills with it. We both made 
              extensive use of Git Bash commands. Besides its personal benefits, GitHub is also what gives our pipeline a clear trigger: 
              whenever a commit is made to the repo via a webhook.

              To host our project, we chose to use a virtual machine on the DigitalOcean platform. Unlike Azure or AWS which typically charge 
              per amount of computation, DigitalOcean has flat rates. We initially purchased a server with 1 vCPU, 1 GB of RAM, and a 25 GB of SSD 
              storage for $5 a month. In the instance that we overloaded our server, it would simply crash instead of scaling out and charging us more.
              This was very benefical for a pair of broke college students. Besides flat rates, DigitalOcean also preforms automatic backups and 
              allows us to monitor various server metrics such as CPU and Disk usage. These later features were useful after getting Jenkins
              and Docker installed on our server, where we did observe some instability. As such, we chose to increase our server RAM to 2 GB, 
              thus resolving the issues.

              The backbone of our project is Jenkins. Hosted on our DigitalOcean server, it is what allows us to automate large portions of
              the deployment process. Instead of running our pipeline on the built-in node, we created a child node. We encountered several issues
              with the built-in node which used its own Jenkins user. The child node logs in as a normal user with sudo permissions, resolving our 
              issues. As mentioned, Jenkins is triggered by commits to our GitHub repo. Specifically, Jenkins is listening for a push webhook
              from GitHub. When triggered, Jenkins will pull the latest version of the repo into the server. Jenkins can execute shell
              commands; however, documentation advises that Jenkins calls a shell script instead of running many commands itself. So, we followed
              this advice. After the script is complete, Jenkins will check the outcome of the build and if it fails, it will notify us through email.

              <p>
              During the configuration of our DigitalOcean server, we extensively used Bash commands. The installation of any sofware, such as 
              Jenkins and Docker, requires the use of the command line as the server is headless. During this installation, we became familiar 
              with the server's file system and how to move through it. Once installation was complete, the use of a Bash script was used to 
              create and deploy the Docker container. A relatively simple bash script is triggered by Jenkins. The script stops the currently 
              running container and stores its ID. The script will move the new files into the correct location before it creates and deploys 
              the new container. After a short delay, it tests to see if the website has been sucessfully deployed. If the deployment has been 
              successful, the previous version's container is removed and the script ends. If it is unsuccessful, the new versions is removed 
              and the previous version is restored with the script returning an error, causing Jenkins to send out email notifications.

              <p>
              The website itself is hosted on a NGINX container created by the Bash script. The container is set up so that it is persistant and 
              will remain up until manually stopped. The container also exposes port 80 so that the website can be accessed through HTTP. 
              The benefit of hosting NGINX in a container instead of directly on our machine is that it allows us to quickly deploy the latest build 
              of our website. With three commands, we can remove the existing container and start the new one. In addition, the utilization of docker
              containers in this project allowed us to become more familar with how they work and to set them up.
